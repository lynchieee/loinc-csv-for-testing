Normally CSF albumin and IgG are derived from the serum, whereas in patients with active multiple sclerosis, the increased CSF IgG is believed to be synthesized within the CSF. The CSF Index is a calculated value which expresses the ratio of IgG to albumin in CSF, to the ratio of IgG to albumin in serum. An elevated ratio suggests local CNS synthesis of IgG. An increased CSF/IgG Index is found in diseases such as MS, neurosyphilis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), chronic CNS infections and CNS lupus erythematosus.",ACTIVE,,1,"IgG index = (IgG, CSF/IgG, serum)/(albumin, CSF/albumin,serum)",,,,Y,Alb; Alb clear; Both serum and cerebrospinal fluid; Cerebral spinal fluid; Cerebrospinal Fl; Chemistry; Cl; Clear; Clearanc; Clearances; Clr; Immune globulin G; Immunoglobulin G; Point in time; Protein.albumin; QNT; Quan; Quant; Quantitative; Random; Ratios; Rto; Serum; Spinal Fl; Spinal Fld; Spinal Flu; Spinal Fluid; SR,IgG/Alb clear Ser+CSF-Rto,Observation,,,,IgG clearance/Albumin clearance [Ratio] in Serum and CSF,,,,,2067,0,,,,,,1.0k,,IgG clearance/Albumin clearance (S+CSF) [Ratio]

This field was adopted for use for tumors diagnosed 1994 forward.    See also Computed Ethnicity Source [210].    One method of identifying persons of Hispanic origin is to apply a standard computer list or algorithm to items 2230 and 2390, the patient's surname and/or maiden name. This has advantages across large populations of being reproducible and facilitating comparisons between areas using identical methods. It may sometimes be possible to identify population denominators in which the same method was used to identify Hispanics. Generally, only central registries will have this capability.    This field provides coding to indicate both that such a computerized name-based method was applied and the results of the method. Coding is independent of that in Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190]. The computer-derived ethnicity may be different from the ethnicity reported by registries in Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190] as code 7 (Spanish Surname Only), because that field may include manual review.

Common symptoms of hyperviscosity are, bleeding, visual signs or symptoms, and neurologic deficits. The viscosity at which symptoms develop is variable, but they rarely appear below a serum or plasma viscosity of 3 cP. Viscosity is reported in units defined as ""rel to H2O"", and are expressed in centipoise (cP).

Less viscous fluid may be seen with inflammation and will have a shorter string. Semen is tested in a similar manner; a normal sample leaves the needle or pipette in small drops with very little trailing thread, while a semen sample that is abnormally viscous forms a thread more than 2 cm long.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS ALSO OCCURS IN OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS AT A LOWER INCIDENCE. NO KNOWN DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS WERE DETECTED. NO NOVEL VARIATIONS WERE DETECTED.

A SINGLE COPY OF THE C677T MUTATION WAS IDENTIFIED. RESULTS FOR THE A1298C MUTATION WERE Negative. THE DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERHOMOCYSTENIMEA CAN NOT RELY ON DNA TESTING ALONE BUT SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION CLINICAL FINDINGS AND OTHER STUDIES, SUCH AS SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS. BECAUSE MTHFR MUTATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED RISKS ARE INHERITED, GENETIC COUNSELING IS RECOMMENDED.     ***GENETIC COUNSELORS ARE AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS THESE RESULTS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AT 1-800-345-GENE***     THE MTHFR ENZYME IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE CIRCULATING FORM OF FOLATE. FOLATE IS IMPORTANT IN HOMOCYSTEINE REGULATION. DEFECTS IN THE MTHFR ENZYME CAN INDIRECTLY CAUSE ELEVATED HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS. THE C677T MUTATION IN THE MTHFR GENE CAN CAUSE ELEVATED HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH INSUFFICIENT FOLATE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE TWO MUTATIONS PRESENT. THE A1298C MUTATION HAS NOT BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LEVATED HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS UNLESS A C677T MUTATION IS ALSO PRESENT. ELEVATED SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, AND VENOUS THROMBOSIS.

Synovial fluid is very viscous due to its high concentration of polymerized hyaluronate and will form a trailing string that is a few inches long when exiting a syringe needle. Less viscous fluid may be seen with inflammation and will have a shorter string. Semen is tested in a similar manner; a normal sample leaves the needle or pipette in small drops with very little trailing thread, while a semen sample that is abnormally viscous forms a thread more than 2 cm long.

49497-1,Platelets,NCnc,Pt,Bld,Qn,Estimate,HEM/BC,2.73,MIN,"In the Hematology world estimated cell counts have existed for many moons and they are reported either qualitatively or quantitatively and done strictly by blood smear review.    Smear Estimated WBC and Platelet counts that aren't just reported as reduced/adequate/many that are actually estimated as a numeric result like an estimate of 4 K/cumm for WBC or 400 K/cumm for platelets. Like doing a retic count by counting so many fields on the smear type of estimate.    This Platelet estimate count is a manual quantitative count. We report a number.   See laboratory procedure:    B. Platelet Count Smear Estimate:    1,       Use the 100X oil immersion objective.  2. Estimate the average number of platelets per field using 10 different fields, where the RBCs are evenly dispersed. Avoid field in which RBCs strongly overlap as this will falsely increase the platelet estimate. Multiply this result by 20,000 to obtain an approximation of the platelet count.  3. A normal platelet count would show 8-20 plt/field; or one platelet per 10-30 RBCs.  4. NOTE: If platelet clumps or satellitism are seen, an estimate cannot be performed. Notify physician of problem. If indicated advise redraw in the appropriate anticoagulant, sodium citrate (blue-top). Order will need to be placed for a CBC SODIUM CITRATE test.

In the confirmatory assay, a second dRVVT is performed using a reagent with additional phospholipids capable of neutralizing the LA. A ratio of the clotting times is calculated from the dRVVT screening test divided by the dRVVT confirmatory test. If a LA is present, the dRVVT confirmatory test will correct to normal. The dRVVT confirmatory reagent also contains a neutralizing agent for heparin in concentrations up to 1 unit/mL. Although patients on Coumadin or patients with deficiencies of factor II, V, and X may show prolonged times, the final ratio will be normal unless a LA is present. The dRVVT confirmatory assay should be run only if the dRVVT screening assay is elevated above the normal reference interval. In thei case, the confirmatory test is done and a ratio is calculated. If the ratio is greater than the upper limit of the established normal reference interval, the LA is present. If the ratio is less than or equal to the upper limit, the LA is absent. The dRVVT screen to confirm ratio formula is based on the 2009 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis lupus anticoagulant testing guidelines.

HLA-SBT should be used in addition to HLA Class 1 serology and/or low to intermediate resolution molecular typing using either SSP(sequence-specific primers) or SSOPH(sequence-specific oligonucleotide blot hydridization) technology.

Some side-effects of Zolpidem include anterograde amnesia, hallucinations, delusions, altered thought patterns, ataxia, euphoria, dysphoria, increased appetite, decreased libido, impaired judgement, increased impulsivity, and uninhibited extroversion in social or personal settings.  The symptoms of overdose include excessive sedation, pin-point pupils, and depressed respiratory function which may progress to coma or death.

(Original reference: Chantarangkul et al., Silica Clotting Time (SCT) as a Screening and Confirmatory Test Detection of the Lupus Anticoagulants. 1992. Thrombosis Research 67:355-365.)  The normalize SCT ratio is calculated as follows:  (Patient Screen Result in seconds / Mean Normal Screen Result in seconds) / (Patient Confirm Result in seconds / Mean Normal Confirm Result in seconds).  The prototype test described by this code is the HemosIL(TM) Silica CLotting Time test.

This term identifies a patient's TTR when the Rosendaal method is used. The Rosendaal method uses linear interpolation to assign an INR value to each day between successive observed INR values. Gaps of greater than 56 days between INR values are not interpolated. After interpolation, the percentage of time during which the interpolated INR values lie within the target therapeutic range is calculated. The formula for TTR for a patient is:  [Number of days that a patient's interpolated INR result is in therapeutic range] / [Number of days for which the patient has an interpolated INR result].

GEL antibody testing (column agglutination technology) is an alternative to tube testing and uses a microtube with a reaction chamber containing dextran acrylamide gel and other elements. Red cells and plasma are added to the gel column top, incubated, and spun.  In the microtubes filled with gel particles and anti-IgG, the particles separate the red cell clusters physically (larger agglutinates, less migration through gel) and the anti-IgG captures the IgG coated red cells and decreases their migration through the gel immunologically.  For negative results, red cells appear in a button at the bottom of the microtube.  For positive results, the red cells are stopped in areas throughout the microtube; the more positive the reaction, the higher the position in the tube.  GEL testing can also be done without IgG in the gel (for ABO testing for example). Sensitivity is similar to PEG testing.

Low ionic strength saline (LISS) is a blood banking potentiating agent that works by decreasing the repelling charges between red cells (zeta potential), thus packing the reds cells closer together for increased antibody bridging.  This then decreases the incubation time for the sensitization phase in the antibody screening.  A downside to using LISS is that it enhances the expression of cold antibodies and auto-antibodies that may not be significant.  In addition, the ratio of serum to red cells must be adhered to strictly to maintain the ionic strength of the mixture. If ionic strength is too high, false negatives may occur, and if it is too low, false positives due to complement binding may occur.",ACTIVE,,1,,,,,,Ab; Bld gp Ab Scn; BLOOD BANK; Low ionic strength saline; Ordinal; Pl; Plasma; Plsm; Point in time; PR; QL; Qual; Qualitative; Random; Scn; Scr; Screen; Scrn; SerP; SerPl; SerPlas; Serum; Serum or plasma; SR,Bld gp Ab Scn SerPl Ql LISS,Both,,,,Blood group antibody screen [Presence] in Serum or Plasma by Low ionic strength saline (LISS),,,,"The PrThr property is used for LOINC terms whose results are reported using an ordered categorical scale, regardless of whether or not an internal threshold was used to make that determination.

Several formulas are available to calculate QTc, including the Bazett formula and the Fridericia formula. Bazett's formula is used most commonly, but for situations in which the patient's heart rate is significantly elevated, the Fridericia formula may yield a more accurate QTc that reflects the QTc that would have been obtained were the patient in normal sinus rhythm.

Therefore for now we replaced 1 with Respiratory system specimen, which will affect 83 term.  The result is replacing ""Respiratory"" with ""Respiratory system specimen"". This is the short approach.  The bigger project is to potentially merge data that has either 1 or 2 together.
